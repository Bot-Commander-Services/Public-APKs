# Version 1.10.3

•Added a keyword searcher in the create command menu.
•Improved the command search bar.
•Various fixes and small changes.

The keyword searcher is something that I think will improve the ability for people to create commands faster without having to memorise or constantly refer to what keywords are available. It appears as this little search button in the bottom end up the create command screen that you press and from there a menu will open where you can search for keywords like $name or something and copy it to your clipboard that you can paste to your command.
The improved command search bar includes an updated look and also has a button on the end when searching that can be used to clear your search.
The various fixes and changes include some bugs fixes. The looks of various buttons and other UI elements are updated to match throughout the app.

The update should go live within a few hours.

Beyond this update I'm not sure how active I will be as my classes are starting up within 2 weeks, but I will try and see if there is anything I can do before then.
